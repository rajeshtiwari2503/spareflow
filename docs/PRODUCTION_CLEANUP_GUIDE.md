## Mock Data Detection Patterns

The system identifies mock/test data using these patterns:

### Email Patterns
- Contains: `demo`, `test`, `mock`, `sample`, `example`
- Domains: `@test.com`, `@demo.com`, `@mock.com`, `@example.com`

### Name Patterns
- Contains: `Demo`, `Test`, `Mock`, `Sample`
- Starts with: `Test `, `Demo `, `Mock `

### Phone Patterns
- Exact matches: `0000000000`, `1234567890`, `9999999999`
- Starts with: `0000`, `1111`, `9999`

### Part Patterns
- Names containing: `Demo`, `Test`, `Mock`, `Sample`
- Codes containing: `DEMO`, `TEST`, `MOCK`
- Descriptions containing: `demo`, `test`, `mock`

## Cleanup Options

### Basic Options

1. **Preserve Parts Structure** (Default: ‚úÖ Enabled)
   - Keeps part definitions but resets stock to 0
   - Maintains catalog structure for production use

2. **Preserve User Accounts** (Default: ‚ùå Disabled for production)
   - Keeps non-mock user accounts
   - Clears all profile data regardless

3. **Preserve System Config** (Default: ‚úÖ Enabled)
   - Maintains pricing rules and system settings
   - Essential for production operation

### Advanced Options

1. **Create Backup** (Default: ‚úÖ Enabled)
   - Creates database backup before cleanup
   - Recommended for safety

2. **Generate Report** (Default: ‚úÖ Enabled)
   - Creates detailed cleanup report
   - Useful for audit trail

3. **Notify on Completion** (Default: ‚úÖ Enabled)
   - Shows completion notifications
   - Helps track cleanup progress

4. **Schedule Cleanup** (Default: ‚ùå Disabled)
   - Allows scheduling cleanup for later
   - Useful for maintenance windows

## How to Execute Cleanup

### Method 1: Admin Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Access Admin Dashboard**
   ```
   Navigate to: /dashboard/super-admin
   ```

2. **Open Cleanup Manager**
   - Look for "Demo Data Cleanup" section
   - Or use the DemoDataCleanupManager component

3. **Configure Options**
   - Review preservation settings
   - Enable/disable advanced options as needed

4. **Safety Checks**
   - Create backup if not already done
   - Review system statistics
   - Use preview function to see impact

5. **Execute Cleanup**
   - Check confirmation checkbox
   - Type "DELETE ALL DEMO DATA" to confirm
   - Click "Execute Cleanup Now"

### Method 2: API Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST /api/admin/cleanup-all-mock-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "confirmCleanup": true,
    "preservePartStructure": true,
    "preserveUserAccounts": false,
    "preserveSystemConfig": true,
    "createBackup": true
  }'
```

### Method 3: Command Line Script

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-demo-data.js \
  --preserve-parts \
  --preserve-config \
  --create-backup
```

## Verification Process

After cleanup completion, the system automatically verifies:

### Zero Count Verification
- Shipments: 0
- Orders: 0
- Transactions: 0
- Notifications: 0
- Activity Logs: 0
- Mock Users: 0 (if not preserving accounts)

### Data Integrity Checks
- No orphaned records
- Foreign key relationships intact
- System configurations preserved

### Production Readiness Indicators
- ‚úÖ All transactional data cleared
- ‚úÖ All mock users removed
- ‚úÖ System configurations intact
- ‚úÖ Database integrity maintained

## Post-Cleanup Steps

### 1. System Verification
- [ ] Test user registration flow
- [ ] Verify dashboard loading
- [ ] Check system configurations
- [ ] Test basic functionality

### 2. Production Setup
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Configure backup schedules
- [ ] Update documentation

### 3. User Onboarding Preparation
- [ ] Prepare onboarding materials
- [ ] Set up support channels
- [ ] Configure notification systems
- [ ] Test access request flows

## Safety Guidelines

### Before Cleanup
- ‚úÖ Create full database backup
- ‚úÖ Verify preservation settings
- ‚úÖ Review preview results
- ‚úÖ Notify team members
- ‚úÖ Schedule during low-traffic hours
- ‚úÖ Test backup restoration process

### During Cleanup
- ‚è≥ Monitor cleanup progress
- ‚è≥ Keep backup accessible
- ‚è≥ Avoid system modifications
- ‚è≥ Document any issues

### After Cleanup
- ‚úÖ Verify cleanup completion
- ‚úÖ Test critical system functions
- ‚úÖ Review cleanup report
- ‚úÖ Update system documentation
- ‚úÖ Monitor system performance
- ‚úÖ Validate production readiness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cleanup Fails with Foreign Key Errors**
   - Solution: Operations are ordered to respect constraints
   - Check for custom relationships not covered

2. **Some Mock Data Remains**
   - Solution: Review detection patterns
   - May need manual cleanup for edge cases

3. **System Performance Issues Post-Cleanup**
   - Solution: Run database optimization
   - Consider reindexing after large deletions

4. **Configuration Lost**
   - Solution: Restore from backup
   - Verify preservation settings were correct

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Partial Failure Recovery**
   ```sql
   -- Check cleanup status
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shipments;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%demo%';
   ```

2. **Full Recovery from Backup**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   pg_restore -d spareflow_db backup_file.sql
   ```
