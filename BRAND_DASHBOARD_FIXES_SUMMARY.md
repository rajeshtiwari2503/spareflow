# Brand Dashboard Shipment Tab - Fixes Summary

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **API Authentication Errors (401/403)**
- **Problem**: Brand Dashboard Shipment Tab showing "authorized service centers & distributors not showing"
- **Root Cause**: API endpoints were failing with 401 authentication errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed authentication middleware in `/api/brand/authorized-service-centers.ts`
  - Fixed authentication middleware in `/api/brand/authorized-distributors.ts`
  - Updated auth verification to use consistent `verifyAuth` function

### 2. **Database Relationship Issues**
- **Problem**: APIs trying to use non-existent `brandId` field on User model
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect database queries not using proper junction tables
- **Solution**:
  - Updated service centers API to use `BrandAuthorizedServiceCenter` junction table
  - Updated distributors API to use `BrandAuthorizedDistributor` junction table
  - Added proper relationship queries with includes for profiles and addresses

### 3. **Notification System Errors (500)**
- **Problem**: Notifications API failing with Prisma validation errors
- **Root Cause**: Invalid Prisma queries using undefined userId and wrong field names
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `/api/notifications.ts` to handle undefined userId properly
  - Fixed `/api/ai-forecasting/notifications.ts` to use correct schema fields
  - Updated queries to use `recipients` array field instead of non-existent `userId`

### 4. **Foreign Key Constraint Violations**
- **Problem**: Unified pricing API failing with foreign key constraint errors
- **Root Cause**: Trying to create CourierPricing records for non-existent brands
- **Solution**:
  - Added brand validation in `setBrandPricingOverride` function
  - Added proper error handling and validation before database operations

### 5. **DTDC API Configuration**
- **Problem**: DTDC integration not working properly
